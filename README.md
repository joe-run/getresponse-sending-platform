# getresponse-sending-platform

## Synopsis
This WordPress plugin allows users to send an email through the email service GetResponse from the WordPress backend. It does so by
scraping the html from designated page on the site, and then passing that over to GetResponse based on the options and
campaign that are selected.

## Code Example
The GetResponse Sending Platform makes use of the GetResponse API. Documentation available at: http://apidocs.getresponse.com/en. The
plugin also uses built-in WordPress functions. Documentation available here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page.

## Goal
The aim for this plugin is to create a simplified method of sending emails through the GetResponse email service. This plugin will
scrape a page from WordPress and send it out as an html email through GetResponse. This method will be faster for end-users and has
the added benefit of supporting media queries for responsive email.

##Installation
Follow the standard WordPress plugin installation method. Documentation available here: https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins.
